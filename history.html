                SHPE South Bay Los Angeles Chapter History

SHPE South Bay was created with the idea of developing an influential network of professionals in the Los Angeles area. A need for a SHPE Professional Chapter arose from local SHPE Student Chapters requesting a professional presence to further enhance SHPE’s vision and mission. During the summer of 2013, a group of recent graduates, along with professionals already in industry, formulated what would be known as SHPE South Bay Los Angeles. Upon this foundation, the group of seven engineers sought to develop the Strategic Plan for SHPE South Bay LA. The plan was founded on the five pillars of SHPE, with community outreach being the area of concentration.

SHPE South Bay defined its mission upon its founding: “SHPE South Bay Los Angeles inspires and empowers the advancement of the Latino community through STEM awareness, access, and support.” Through this statement, SHPE South Bay sought to create opportunities and relationships with STEM professionals in the Los Angeles area. The SHPE South Bay Los Angeles Professional Chapter was officially recognized in October 2013 during the SHPE National Conference. Today, SHPE South Bay LA continues to strive for a South Bay where Latinos are united as a community and are respected as influential STEM leaders.
